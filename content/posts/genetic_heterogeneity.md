## JOINING THE LAB

We are always looking for talented new group members. Backgrounds vary widely, from plant molecular biology to statistics, but everyone is expected to be willing to learn to analyze their own data.

Prospective students and postdocs should **write me directly, explaining what you are interested in, and why**. Please attach a CV. Postdocs are expected to have at least one first-author publication in a major international journal. You are expected to be competitive for postdoctoral fellowships and apply for them if eligible (we are happy to help).
